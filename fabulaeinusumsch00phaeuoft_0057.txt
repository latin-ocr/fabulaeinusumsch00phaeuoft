LIBER TERTIUS·

(Cujus non fugio mortem, si famam assequar,
Et cedo invidiae, dummodo absolvar cinis,)

E populo sic nescio quis, ut fieri solet,

‘⁶ Quaeso, tam angustam, talis vir, ponis domum ?'’

‘⁶ Utinam‚'’ inquit, “veris hane amicis impleam.'' 5

DE CREDERE ΕΤ NON CREDERE.

Pssmeutosum est credere, et non credere3

Utriusque exemplum breviter exponam rei.

Hippolytus obiit, quia novercae creditum est :

his pupils. The reputation
which his wisdom and virtue
obtained, excited against him
the hatred of the envious;
and his enemies accused him
of corrupting the Athenian
youth, and of making inno-
vations in the religion of his
country. Although this ac-
cusation was unfounded in
truth‚ false witnesses ap-
peared to corroborate it, and
the philosopher was con-
demned to die by drinking
poison. When the hour of
his death approached, a cup
of hemlock was presented to
him, which he drank with a
calm and unaltered counte-

nance, and in a few minutes
expired.

2 Ciuis, when I am re·
duced to ashes.

4 Talis vir, why do you,
who are so great a man.

8 Hippolyta& the son of
Theseus and Hippolyte,
celebrated for his virtues
and misfortunes. Having
been falsely aecused by his
step-mother Phaedra of a
heinous crime, he was
obliged to fly from the re-
sentment of his father, and
as he was pursuing his ssight,
he was thrown from his
chariot and killed.

Creditum est, credit
given.
