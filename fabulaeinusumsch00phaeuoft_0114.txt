The object of the compiler has been to reduce into a small compass, and

ζ, at a reasonable price, for the use of Colleges and Schools‚ the best informa-
! tion and most useful matter, found hitherto in several dIstinct volume& l
With this view he has condensed the contents of the Gaiana-Examen ’

part into so small a space (at the same time retaining a lai-ger number of

words than any other volume of the same size) as to leave room sor the ,

introduction of an ENGLxsn-GREEK Lexicon at least twice as compre-
hensive as any that has yet appeared.

“ This is a worthy companion to Riddle's Latin Dictionary, containing
all the information necessary to a student; and, what is of equal irn-
portance, no more. The author is generally successful in developinsr, the
structure and composition of the Greek lanzuage3 avoiding the quibbling·
derivations which ‹lisfigure the older lexicons, and especially that of
Schrevehus, he points out the genuine radicals so far as they can be dis-
covered with certainty.'’-ATHENAEUM.
