4 PHAEDRI FABULARUM

Hinc conspiratis factionum partibus,

Arcem tyrannus occupat Flsistratus.

Cum tristem servitutem flerent Attici,

Non quia crudelis ille, sed quoniam grave

Omnino insuetis onus, et coepissent queri,

01

EEsopus talem turn fabellam retulit.

Ranae, vagantes liberis paludibus,

Clamore magno regem petiere a Jove,

l conspiratis factionum par-
tibus, factions conspiring to-
gether.

‘2 Arcem, the citadel, the
supreme power.

TyramzuS, as if he had been
the king ; this word does not
always signify a cruel or des-
potic monarch, but some-
times a good king, and some-
times a usurper.

Pisistratus, an eloquent
and brave Athenian, the son
of Hippocrates. Although
Solon and Lycurgus strenu-
ously opposed his ambitious
designs, yet by his artifice
and popularity he made him-
self master of the govern-
ment of his country. Soon
after his elevation to the
supreme power, conspiracies
were formed against him;
and in order to keep the
people quiet‚'and to recon-
cile them to the governor of
their city, AEsop delivered
the following fable. Though

he was thus assisted by the
philosopher, the opposers of
Pisistratus succeeded in their
endeavours to banish him
from Athens, but he was
shortly restored to power:
he was however, a second
time obliged to fly srom his
country3 and such was the
diversity of his fortune, that
after having passed eleven
years in an obscure retreat
in Euboea, he was again
acknowledged as the sove-
reign of the city, and held
the supreme power till his
death.

3 Attici, the inhabitants of
Attica, the Athenians.

4 Ille: erat is understood.

Grave: erat is understood.

5 Omnino insuetis, to them.
who were altogether unac-
customed to any restraint on
their liberty.

8 Jove, the ablative case of
Jupiter, the name of the chief
of the gods.
