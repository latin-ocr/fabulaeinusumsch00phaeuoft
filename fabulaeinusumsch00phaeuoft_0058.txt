PH AEDRI FABULARUM

Cassandrae quia non creditum, ruit Ilium.

Ergo exploranda est veritas multum, prius

Quam stulta prave judicet sententia.

Sed fabulosa ne vetustate elevem,

Narrabo tibi, memoria quod factum est mea. 5

Maritus quidam cum diligeret conjugem,

Togamque puram jam pararet filio,

1 Cassandra to Cassan-
dra, the daughter of Priam
and Hecuba. She received
from Apollo the knowledge
of futurity, but he caused
that her predictions should
alw ay s be disregarded.
W hen the wooden horse was
brought into Tf’ij' she fore-
warned her countrymen that
it would occasion the de-
struction of their city, but no
credit was given to her pro-
phecy, and Troy became a
heap of ruins.

Ilium, Troy, a city of
Asia. To avenge the cause
of Menelaus, whose v. ife had
been carlied away by Paris,
the son of the king of Troy,
all the Grecian princes
united their forces and be-
sieged this city; but the in-
habitants defended it with
so much brav cry and success
during a period of ten ywens,
that the Greeks at lcng th

despaired of reducing it by
force. Recourse was there-
fore had to artifice. They
secretly filled a large wooden
horse with armed men, and
withdrew their armies from
the plains of Troy. This
horse the Trojans brought
within their walls, and when
night approached, their ene-
mies. who were concealed in
it, rushed out, set fire to the
city, and put the greatest
part of the inhabitants to the
sword.

3 Stulta sententia, a weak
judgment.

4 Fabulosci vetustate, by
antiquated stories.

Togam puram, a plain
gown. Till they reached
their seventcenth y‚ear the
Roman youths wore a purple
fringe round their dress,
which was termed toga prce-
teoeta.
